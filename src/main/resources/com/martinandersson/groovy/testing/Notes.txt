Groovy API:
    http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/gapi/

API source code:
    https://github.com/apache/groovy

The Groovy API show no class hierarchy. Thank god a normal JavaDoc version of the docs with the hierarchy exists here:
    http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/api/

"Groovy Development Kit enhancements" / "Describes the methods added to the JDK to make it more groovy":
(unfortunately for all serious programmers this API does not have a class hierarchy nor have I found a source for it)
    http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/groovy-jdk/

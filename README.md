### Groovy testing

My personal playground for Groovy. Use at your own risk, feel free to contribute.

So far, my impression of Groovy is that they have managed to come up with some good ideas and I can see why people use it for DSL:s and scripts, but, Groovy can not be used for serious application development. This language is full of weird surprises (for example, private and protected keywords exists but has no meaning and final local variables are mutable), bugs and it is more complex than any other scripting language I've ever laid my eyes on (I'm mostly thinking of a godzillion different hook methods, some of which even change semantics).

### Groovy testing

My personal playground for Groovy. Use at your own risk, feel free to contribute.

So far, my impression of Groovy is that they have managed to come up with some good ideas, but, this language is full of weird surprises, bugs and it is more complex than any other scripting language I've ever laid my eyes on.

For example, private and protected keywords exists but has no meaning and final local variables are mutable. There exists a godzillion different hook methods. At least one such method even change semantics depending on how it is used (invokeMethod) and the call order is not exactly easy to decipher.

I get a feeling that "anything goes" with Groovy and I can see why people use it for DSL:s and scripts. Me personally and thus far, I would never consider Groovy as a plausible candidate for large-scale serious application development.
